# vonblog-gui

## Ideas

* [x] Bitbucket integration that loads files, presented as a file navigation.
* [x] Grammar/ Spellcheck
    * Cheated by making the preview Editable w' Spellchjeck
* [x] Preview with HTML and the VonExplaino theme
* FeatureImage and Media: have a media selector tied with Bitbucket locations. As in a file navigation of the media
* [x] Gallery helper button
* [ ] On save, lock the post until it can pull a version back from GitHub w' extra fields from the blog generator. Eg. the Mastodon link
   * [ ] `vonblog` updates the file with an "XPOST" comment in the commit; so we can wait for one of those after the commit date of the original?
